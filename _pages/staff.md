      KVCM.Live is an all digital lab. It is run in combination with Broadcasting classes and the Broadcasting club at LAVC. The purpose is for students to be able to express their ideas, thoughts, stories, and music in a radio and podcasting setting to further their educational goals in relation to media.<br/><br/>Diversity is a core value of the new 95.1 KVCM, Monarch Radio. We welcome, value, and promote diversity among staff, students, and our community. We cultivate a respectful, inclusive, and accessible working and learning environment. We work effectively in different cultural contexts to serve the educational and linguistic needs of a diverse community and we develop the capacity to understand issues of difference, power, and privilege. Thank you for listening and participating.
