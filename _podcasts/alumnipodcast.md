The Alumni Podcast is an opportunity for the Professor to interview his past students about their experience at Los Angeles Valley College in Broadcasting and an opportunity to reconnect with them to find out how their education led to the careers they have today. This podcast airs within the Audio Playground on Throwback Thursdays and can be found on SoundCloud as well.
